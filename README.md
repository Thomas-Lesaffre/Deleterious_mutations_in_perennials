# On Deleterious mutations in perennials


This repository relates to a manuscript that will soon be posted on _BioRXiv_. 

In this paper, we ask whether mutations affecting fitness differently with respect to life-history may explain the large differences in inbreeding depression observed between perennials and annuals. To do so, we combine a physiological growth model and multilocus population genetics approaches in order to describe a full genotype-to-phenotype-to-fitness map, where the phenotype relates to fitness through biological assumptions, so that the fitness landscape emerges from biological assumptions instead of being assumed a priori. We study the behaviour of different types of mutations affecting growth or survival, and explore their consequences in terms of inbreeding depression and mutation load. Then, we discuss the role deleterious mutations maintained at mutation-selection balance may play in the coevolution between growth and survival strategies.
